# Tree

## Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Create a BinaryTree class
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write tests to prove the following functionality:

1. Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
2. Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
3. Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
4. Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
5. Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
6. Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
