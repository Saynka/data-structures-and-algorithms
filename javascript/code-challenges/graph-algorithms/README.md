# Graph implementation

## Kale lesko / Clement Buchanan

## Challenge

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

add node
Arguments: value
Returns: The added node
Add a node to the graph
add edge
Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
Returns: nothing
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
If specified, assign a weight to the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
get nodes
Arguments: none
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
get neighbors
Arguments: node
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
size
Arguments: none
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency

create a class that scycles threw a list and gives the next value to the next line of code

# Graph implementation - breadth-first

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
