# Fifo animal shelter

## Challenge

- Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
  Implement the following methods:
- enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
- dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency

create a class that scycles threw a list and gives the next value to the next line of code
